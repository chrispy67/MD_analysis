This is a small collection of files that have been used to analyze trajectory data from molecular dynamics simulations. Project worked with Marlo Zorman and other Pfaendtner Research Group members.

There are also some helpful scripts for managing datasets that were helpful when curating large datasets for reweighting. The file 'mbar.py' was provided by Tucker Burgin as a standalone script from https://atesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
